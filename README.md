📱 Teen Smartphone Addiction: Data & ML Insights

This repository explores the hidden costs of excessive smartphone usage among teenagers. Beyond being a communication tool, smartphones shape study habits, sleep routines, and even mental health. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning, this project investigates whether “screen time” is just a harmless routine—or a predictor of declining well-being.

🌟 Aim of the Project

Understand how daily smartphone usage patterns manifest in teenagers’ lifestyles.
Quantify the relationship between addiction severity, academic performance, and mental health indicators.
Develop predictive insights that could guide parents, schools, and communities toward healthier digital practices.

🛠 Tools & Frameworks

Core Language: Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, scikit-learn
Environment: Google Colab

📊 Major Components

Data Processing: Cleaning raw data, treating missing values, removing duplicates, encoding categorical variables, and exporting a polished dataset.
Behavioral Analysis: Identifying the most time-consuming smartphone activities and analyzing daily/weekly screen time patterns.
Academic Correlation: Examining how screen exposure and bedtime phone usage affect grades and study efficiency.
Sleep & Well-Being: Measuring the impact of late-night usage on sleep duration, quality, and mental health outcomes (stress, anxiety, depression).
Visual Storytelling: Rich visualizations (heatmaps, scatterplots, boxplots, time-series charts, and interactive dashboards).
Machine Learning (Bonus): Predicting academic performance and addiction levels using classification/regression models.
